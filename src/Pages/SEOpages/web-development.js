          <Typography variant="h2">Why Web Development?</Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p">
            According to the latest statistics, the average attention span of an
            internet user has decreased from 12 seconds to 8 seconds. However,
            on the other hand, more than 45% of people expect a web page to load
            in 2 seconds or earlier!
            <br/><br/>
            This means that you have only 8 seconds to catch the attention of
            your visitor on a landing page that has to be loaded in 2 seconds or
            less.
            <br/><br/>
            This is the place where web development draws our attention towards
            itself. In order to sustain the visitor on a website, its design
            must be kinda interesting. However, web development is held
            responsible for the loading time.
